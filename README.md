This image demonstrates the commands necessary to start the application.

## Usage

Once you enter your responses to the questions, you will be generated a professional README document with complete license section, table of contents, and description. If you wish to add images to the README, you will need to add the files manually to the repository you are using the README for.

The application will give you the choice of three different licenses: MIT, ISC, and Unlicense. Whichever license you choose will have a link to the license on opensource.org linked at the top in the license badge and generate a license section at the bottom with the license itself.
